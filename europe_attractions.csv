You will be surprised with the beauty of Naples and the islands.... And with this opportunity you are also granted special permission to ride in the national park of Vesuvius, instead of taking the bus with all the other tourists!
You will be escorted by coach from your hotel and driven to the stable where you will be given a short briefing by our professional guide. You will then embark on your relaxing tour, riding under the trees, passing by grape fields, climbing up ancient railways, following the way of lava, stopping by the volcanic rocks for a breathtaking view; and of course some pictures; and then galloping up the path and back....
You will be on horseback for around 2-2.5 hours, depending on how fast you are. And after the tour, the couch will drive you back to your hotel. (or to Pompeii, Herculaneum, if you prefer to visit the ruins afterwards)
Don’t worry if you’ve never ridden before. You won’t be the only one and the course is designed for beginners, children and all experience levels. (Little children can ride with their parents or with our guides)
We require a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 9 people to organize the tours. However, if you are a lone traveler, contact us anyways and we will add you one of the confirmed groups.

La Neapolis Sotterrata - Complesso Monumentale San Lorenzo Maggiore,"['Sights & Landmarks', 'Museums', 'Ancient Ruins', 'Historic Sites', 'History Museums']","Historical Description When was Neapolis founded? It is not clear the specific date but archaeological studies show the late sixth - early fifth century BC. Initially were only inhabitants coming from the city of Cuma, then others settlers were also added: Calcidesi, Pithecusan, (today's citizens from Ischia) and the Athenians. The urban layout of Neapolis is structured in a regular network of streets. History and archeology, architecture, sculpture and painting of San Lorenzo Maggiore Complex had already written important chapters in the history of Naples. It can be assumed that St. Lawrence complex - geographically and topographically- is the heart of Old Naples The deepest backgrounds of the complex of San Lorenzo can be found in the basement of the Greek - Roman Neapolis, at the ""Via Augustale"", where, in the Roman period were stationed the general markets. At the end of the fifth century AD, a huge flood, a mixture of mud, stones and water buried the whole area. Later it was built an Early Christian Basilica dedicated to St. Lawrence Martyr. John Bishop of Aversa donated the early Christian basilica of S. Lorenzo to the Friars Minor, in 1234. The primary Basilica was later replaced by the current monument, which construction began in 1284 under King Charles I of Anjou. The Friars Minor have devised the new complex of S. Lorenzo, supported and protected by the Anjou King, who provided a constant devotion to the brothers of St. Francis of Assisi, favoring them with generous donations and lands. A particular event explains the deep pledge between the Angevin sovereigns to the Friars Minor: a son of Charles II of Anjou, Ludovico, attracted by Franciscan Friaries way, joined the Order of Friars Minor. Ludovico was elected bishop of Toulouse Immediately after his religious profession. He had lived poor and died very young, in 1297; he was canonized in 1317 by Pope John XXII. The Archeological Area The model that we cross just entered the cloister, makes us understand how was settled the Roman market. Neapolis had three main streets: the upper decumanus currently via Anticaglie; the Major decumanus currently Via Tribunali and the lower decumanus, currently Via San Biaggio dei Librai or better known as Spaccanapoli. The underground archaeological area of San Lorenzo Maggiore extends below the transept of the Angevin church, the chapter house and the southern arm and the west of the monastery. The monument in tuff blocks of IV-III century. B.C. was replaced by a building market to the imperial age. It is arranged on two floors exploiting the existing natural gap between the portion of the street stalls and the Courts of stenopos in alignment with Vico Giganti, visible in the archaeological underground area. The complex as a whole seems to be the result of a unified building program, but it is currently not possible to determine what date from the initial phase of this impressive monumental structure is. The most recognizable part of the romans buildings is date based by the technical construction in the late first - early second century. A.D., after the earthquakes of 62 and 64 A.D. and the eruption of 79 A.D. Only a few clues remain of the late Republican and Augustan period, despite the Emperor Augustus and his descendants has been attributed many edifice projects in the city. The construction previous mentioned was composed of two floors. The first floor was occupied by ""macellum"", a market intended for sale of foodstuffs, consisting of a rectangular space porch with circular pavilion of the tholos at the center. It invokes a common type of Hellenistic period, attested to the imperial age in Campania at Pompeii and Pozzuoli in the Serapeum. The tholos was part of an enclosure with a mosaic of large white tiles, which opened a porch covered with marble slabs. The tholos was a small temple. It was the place where merchants were offering the first fruits to God hoping to get back multiply profits. The basement of the circular building is preserved, three steps with a few tracks with marble facing and part of a terracotta funnel. It is now partially visible an oval slot realized on the occasion of the re-paving of the cloister. The main entrance was on Via Tribunali, while the stairs connect the lower level of the monument, to the portion of stenapos in the underground archaeological area.The eastern front of the complex includes a small building in the North organized into two narrow shafts interconnected with brick facade punctuated by a pediment with two pilasters, in which a door opens and a tiny window of a thick railing. Toward to the south nine tabernae bipartite in two adjoining spaces, with a vaulted ceiling: the facade is made of brickwork, instead the perimeter walls and partitions of rooms were in reticulate. In such environments can be observed, reflecting the commercial use of the area, elements such as an oven and tanks, which, often documenting phases of use of a later period the original structure. a. The first tavern is ""Erarium"" today would be called the bank. Probably romans preserved the treasure of the city! The place is particularly interesting for the signs from the big iron bars. b. Tabernae fulloniche today would be called dyeing. You can admire tubs and sinks where were brought cloths, washed and dyed with natural detergents soda, clay, purple and uric acid. c. Bakery. Someone jokingly calls ""the grandmother’s pizzerias” It is interesting to note the shape of the dome of the oven and the cooker top. To the south of the modular system, tabernae bind to a cryptoporticus, a long basement corridor reticulate and brick arches with barrel vaults, divided into smaller adjoining rooms. The building rests, using as the back wall, on the screen in yellow tuff blocks of the fourth century BC phase. In the cryptoporticus can be admired the stone counters, of uncertain interpretation, however, given the presence of small flow channels of water perhaps were used to expose and sell fish. Entering in a new environment where you notice a water collector, perhaps of Greek origin: it is important to note the arrangement of stones, placed in barrels, round shape with a particular shape and without the mortar between the stones. All block interlocked. The age we talk about 150-200 BC The following environments were more elegant edifices, that were built with better materials as can be seen from the mosaic floors and “impluvium”, a gush of water inputs of Roman."" These rooms were a particularly popular venue for meetings of philosophers and political scientists called ""scole"". In the last area after the corridor, on the right wall, you can see a few remains of frescoes and mosaic floor in particular. Chapter Hall In the middle of the east side of the cloister is the entrance to the Chapter Hall, decorated with a Gothic portal of the second quarter of the fourteenth century, flanked by beautiful windows with four lights and surmounted by a low arch bezel. Above these beautiful quadrifore it was found parts of a fresco (and recently restored), probably painted by a strict observance unknown artist disciple of Giotto around 1340, depicting St. Francis, who gives the rule to friaries and the Poor Clares of Assisi. The fresco was detached years ago and kept inside of the Museum; it is curious to observe how this fourteenth-century fresco was the model of the table of Colantonio with the same subject, part of the altarpiece for the Sanchez family, one time was kept in San Lorenzo but now is on the Museum of Capodimonte. The Chapter Hall is 7.50 meters high, wide 16.30 meters and deep 12.8 meters. It preserves the Gothic structure, with six vaults supported by two ancient granite bare columns; in what reminds the Chapter House of St. Augustine at the Mint in Naples, built slightly earlier. There are frescoes with grotesque decorations, allegorical figures of Sand and Villa, with a small central fresco depicting the Virgin Mary and under the 1608 date; in the surrounding walls there are paintings in the shape of trees with fruits representatives of people (men and women) of great cultural value, theological, scientists, kings and queens, followers of St. Francis of Assisi. Its author was almost certainly Luigi Rodriguez. The Sisto V Hall The Sixtus V Hall consists of a great rectangular hall, 43.60 meters long and wide 9.80 meters. The main entrance is an elegant antique vestibule Swabian which, according to Celano, was once frescoed. This majestic hall was for a long time the place of the Neapolitan Parliament meeting. The frescoes on the walls and on the vaults date back to the early 17 century were executed by Luigi Rodriguez, during the reign of Philip III, commissioned by the Viceroy Ferdinando Ruiz Castro and Andrada. The vault is divided into seven compartments, each of which are painted life-size seven Virtues; more precisely, at the center of each compartment it is depicted one of the seven main virtues (Clemenza, Providence, Gravity, Magnificence, Dignity Director, magnanimity, affability), surrounded by four smaller Virtue for each main one. In the semicircles of lateral arch can be seen views of Naples that correspond to the different provinces of the Kingdom: today you can admire them only six. Finally, the decoration of the room is completed with coats of arms, arabesques and allegories. Only the lower part of the perimeter walls, for a height of 4 meters from the floor, it was not covered with frescoes: it was the custom to cover these portions of walls with tapestries and precious fabrics to increase the local magnificence.",40.85093,4.5,14.25714,Naples,"Piazza San Gaetano 316, 80138",7360298,train

The noblewoman Priscilla, who granted the Church use of the property, was a member of this family; her commemoration is noted on January 16th in the Roman Martyrology, which speaks of her as a benefactor of the Christian community in Rome. This cemetery was lost like all the others after the entrances were blocked to protect it from thievery; however, it was also one of the first to be rediscovered, in the sixteenth-century. A large portion of the funerary inscription, sarcophagi, stone and bodies (presumed to be those of martyrs) were subsequently taken away; nevertheless, the catacomb does preserve some particularly beautiful and important paintings, the most significant of which are included on the regular visit.",41.92954,4.5,12.508434,Rome,"Via Salaria, 430, 00199",246072,train

Military History Museum,"['Museums', 'Military Museums']","The Museum on the Berlin-Gatow airfield is a branch of the Bundeswehr Museum of Military History. Like its parent agency in Dresden, it does not see itself primarily as a museum of technical history, but rather as a modern museum of cultural history.The Museum in Dresden tells a general cultural history of violence, whereas the Berlin Museum focuses on aerial warfare as the most recent development in the military use of force.Visitors will learn how aerial warfare has altered our views on warfare. The following topics are at the center of our presentation:• Crossing Borders. Airplanes enable us to transport information, diplomats and casualties quickly and across borders. At the same time, the emergence of the aerial bombing warfare resulted in the abolition of the old dichotomy between front and hinterland.• Invisible Perpetrators, Invisible Victims. Among other things, aerial warfare is characterized by high speeds, tremendous ranges and increasingly huge kill capacities. These characteristics result in a depersonalization in the relationship between perpetrators and victims.• Cover instead of Flight. People on the ground are practically unable to escape the violence from the air. They are faced with sudden alarms and have to look for cover in cellars and holes in the ground.• Role Models. The role of a pilot has changed continuously over the years: In the eyes of his contemporaries, he was a daring technical pioneer and knight of the air, a daredevil, an engine operator and a flight engineer. Pilots were sacrificed and became killers. Not all pilots are men. What will be their role in an era of unmanned aviation?• Military and Society. The doctrines of employment and the manner of taking responsibility for the protection of lives reflect the political system and self-image of the various air forces. For that reason, military aviation cannot be examined separately but must be seen in the context of its social and political environment.The Museum of Military History on the Berlin-Gatow airfield sees itself a place of learning for military Bundeswehr personnel as well as interested visitors. As an interface between the military and society, it hopes to encourage discussions and to contribute towards the integration of the armed forces into public life in Germany.The museum collection contains more than 200 airplanes, numerous air defence systems and sensors, uniforms, equipment, art, documents and pictures (a total collection of 600,000 items).",52.472485,4.5,13.138438,Berlin,,1798574,train

Today’s Mauerpark is on land that ran between the two parallel walls separating East and West Berlin. With its observation towers, attack dogs, trip wires and armed guards primed to shoot anyone trying to escape to the West, it was known as the “death strip.” The park dates back to the early 1990s when local residents, noticing the rapid spread of self-seeded vegetation on the sandy strip of land, began planting trees and calling for the creation of a park. As a result, the city’s politicians included Mauerpark in the city’s bid to host the 2000 Olympics. Although Berlin’s bid for the Olympics was not successful, the plea to build Mauerpark was. In Mauerpark you can take a stroll, lie around, read, play on the swings, play boules and basketball, picnic in the birch grove, get involved in community gardening, go to the Rainbow Playground with the kids, watch musicians and performers in the amphitheatre, have a drink and a bite to eat in the outdoor cafes or hunt for bargains at the Sunday flea market.",52.54276,4.5,13.403179,Berlin,"Gleimstr. 55, 10437 Berlin, 10437",1885199,validation

Limone,"['Food & Drink', 'Distilleries']","In the heart of the ancient Neapolis near the ""Decumano Maggiore"" recognized asUNESCO World Heritage, Limone offers with its production the flavours and thefragrances of the Napolitantradition. Limone is much more than a simple factory of liquors: it wants to follow the traditions handed downfrom generation to generation in order to discover the pleasure of sharing together the traditional and genuine flavours and aromas. A firm able to bring the traditions in the place where they were born: this was the project when Limone started its activities. The idea is still the same. Limone is the place where one can still find genuine and handmade food production as well as the flavours of homemade liquors. Limoncello, creams, rucolino (liquor with arugula), finocchietto (liquor with selvatic fennel), and baba (Napolitan cake), are just some products which gave notoriety to our brand. The secret of our success is based on the handmade production as well as on the traditional recipes. Limone achieved remarkable results through a particular attention on the quality of its production, which is internationally recognized. This is the reason why Limone is recommendedon the most famous Naples guidebooks (Routard, Lonely Planet, Hachette, Dumont) whichsuggest to visit our small factory. Limonebegan with the production of few liquors, then inspired by the Napolitan handmade tradition itintroduced other products. The most famous liquor is the limoncello, which is prepared following an ancient family recipe. Our limoncello is produced using a particular green lemon called ""verdello"" with excellent digestive proprieties and produced without chemicals. Each lemon is peeled by hand as it was an homemade process. All the lemons come from ""CampiFlegrei""and the harvest is without chemicals or phytopharmaceutical products. Our peculiarity is that Limone does not produce just liquors, while a variety of products based on lemon (pasta with lemon, lemon grappa, lemon olive oil, to name but a few). During the visit of our factory we explain to our clients the whole productive process and they often feel at home. Limone is also a sort of archeological museum: inside our factory there are a well of IV century B.C. Which was part of the Greek aqueduct as well as a wall in ""opus reticulatum"" of Dioscuri's Temple. The liquors testing and the archeological visit is an incredible surprise for our clients. Finally, the key of success was our clients affection. They increasedyear by year recognizing the efforts of our small enterprise. Many clients come back bringing their friends, and they act as small Limone promoters. Many of them became very expert guide regarding liquors production. We were born in 1996 as a small factory, but nowadays we are an unmissablestop-over during the city historical center tour. The creativity of the young managers tends to continuously find new synthesis between tradition and innovation. Our motto always was: ""Conservareilsapore e conservareiilsapere"" (Preserve a flavor means preserving knowledge).",40.850983,5.0,14.257092,Naples,"Piazza San Gaetano, 72, 80138",5570882,validation

Abbazia di San Paolo Fuori Le Mura,"['Sights & Landmarks', 'Churches & Cathedrals', 'Sacred & Religious Sites']","At the beginning of the 4th century, with the end of the persecutions and the promulgation of the Edicts of Tolerance in favour of Christianity, Emperor Constantine ordered the excavation of the cella memoriae, the place where Christians venerated the memory of Saint Paul the Apostle, beheaded under Nero around 65-67 A.D. Above his grave, located along the Ostiense Way, about two kilometers outside the Aurelian Walls surrounding Rome, Constantine built a Basilica which was consecrated by Pope Sylvester in 324. Between 384 and 395 the Basilica, under the emperors Theodosius, Valentinian II and Arcadius, was restored and enlarged according to an extensive project consisting of five naves opening out into an atrium (quadriportico), or courtyard with four rows of columns. Throughout the centuries the Basilica would not cease to be embellished and enhanced by the Popes. For example, the massive defensive wall was built to protect against invasions at the end of the ninth century, while the bell tower and the magnificent Byzantine door were constructed in the eleventh century. Other important additions include Pietro Cavallini’s mosaics in the facade, the beautiful Vassalletto family’s cloister, Arnolfo di Cambio’s celebrated Gothic baldachin and the Candelabrum for the Paschal candle attributed to Nicola d’Angelo and Pietro Vassalletto of the thirteenth century. This historical period represents the golden age of what had been the biggest Basilica of Rome, until the consecration of the new Basilica of St. Peter in 1626. This sacred place of Christian pilgrimage was well-known for its artistic works. On the night of July 15, 1823, a fire destroyed this unique testimony to the Paleo-Christian, Byzantine, Renaissance and Baroque periods. The Basilica was reconstructed identically to what it had been before, utilizing all the elements which had survived the fire. In 1840 Pope Gregory XVI consecrated the Altar of the Confession and the Transept. Other embellishments followed the reconstruction. In 1928 the portico with 150 columns was added. Contemporary work in the Basilica has uncovered the tomb of the Apostle, while other important and beneficial works are carried out, as in the past, thanks to the generosity of Christians from all over the world. In the fifth century under the Pontificate of Leo the Great, the Basilica became the home of a long series of medallions which would to this day depict all the popes throughout history. This testifies, in an extraordinary way, to “the very great, the very ancient and universally known Church founded and organized at Rome by the two most glorious Apostles, Peter and Paul” (Saint Irenaeus, Adversus Haereses 3, 3,2). Saint Paul Outside-the-Walls constitutes an extra-territorial complex (Motu Proprio by Pope Benedict XVI, 30 May 2005), administered by an Archpriest. In addition to the Papal Basilica, the entire complex includes a very ancient Benedictine Abbey, restored by Odon of Cluny in 936. This Abbey remains active even today under the direction of its Abbot who retains his ordinary jurisdiction intra septa monasterii. The Benedictine Monks of the ancient Abbey, founded near the tomb of the Apostle by Pope Gregory II (715-731), attend to the ministry of Reconciliation (or Penance) and the promotion of special ecumenical events. It is in this Basilica that every year on the feast of the Conversion of Saint Paul, January 25, the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity solemnly opens. The Pope has specified two privileged tasks for this Papal Basilica: the Sacrament of Reconciliation (or Penance) and the development and organization of ecumenical initiatives. On June 28, 2007, Pope Benedict XVI visited the Basilica and announced that the following year would be designated the “Pauline Year” to commemorate the bimillennium of the birth of Saint Paul. Thus, the “Pauline Year” was run from June 28, 2008 to June 29, 2009.",41.85783,5.0,12.477849,Rome,"Via Ostiense 186, 00146",198747,test

Other cocktails would later follow on the drinks menu, such as Gin Fizz, Margaritas, Negronis, Whisky Sours, amongst others. When Javier de las Muelas took over his legacy, he wanted to maintain the essence of the classic Cocktail Bar, preserving its English characteristics such as the leather, wood and brass present in the entire premises. He wished to maintain the already unique image, although expanding the Cocktail menu with classic cocktails and his own genuine, exclusive and innovative creations. But always distinguishing the cocktail to which it owns its name: the Dry Martini. A clear example of reverence is the art collection on the walls, dedicated to that same cocktail. Dry Martini by Javier de las Muelas has been listed for as one of World's 50 Best Bars, honour granted to only six bars in the world, Dry Martini being the first in Europe to achieve such a position for the same amount of time.",41.39253,4.5,2.154056,Barcelona,"Carrer d'Aribau 162-166, 08036",5907385,test
